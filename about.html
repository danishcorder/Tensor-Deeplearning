    <h2>Understanding the Role of Tensors in Deep Learning</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Tensors are the core data structures in modern deep learning. From image classification to natural language processing, tensors represent data and enable efficient computation across neural networks. This project highlights what tensors are, how they are used in AI, and how we can visualize them.
    </p>
    <h3>Tools Used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Python: For scripting and tensor operations</li>
      <li>NumPy/PyTorch: To define and manipulate tensors</li>
      <li>Matplotlib/Plotly: For plotting tensors and transformations</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Tensors are essential for how deep learning systems understand and process data. Their multi-dimensional structure supports complex operations across neural networks. Visualizing these tensors makes it easier to understand how AI models learn patterns from data.
